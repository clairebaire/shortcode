# Shortcode

This is a fun little project I started when I was thinking of a jQuery-esque library, but targeting ES6+/ESNext and written in TypeScript. This is an attampt to make it in public, so enjoy.

## Intent

This library is meant to create "shortcodes" of more complex functions with modern JS principles. Modern JS is powerful, but sometimes it's verbose! The idea behind this is just to make shortcodes of commonly-used DOM APIs.
